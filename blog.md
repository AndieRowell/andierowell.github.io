# Hello World!
### Hi, hello there, my name is Andie and this is the start of my coding journey!

## Week 1 (8/21 - 8/25):
First week back at **Awesome Inc's** web developer bootcamp and I'm honestly really excited! I was previously in the last cohort for the remote summer session, but ended up having to pause and push to join this fall session instead. Going from feeling super overwhelmed and not having a grip on what was going on in my life a few months ago to now, I feel a lot better and like I can get a second wind. I know I can do this, just life happens when you least expect it, so I'm really excited to start again.


I spent the last couple months in between spending time with family and going over some of the topics I never felt like I could fully give my attention to at the time. One of those was **git**! Or more specifically the whole **git flow** of using vscode on my local machine with github. I'm really glad I spent more time going over that, because now I'm more confident in what feels like the foundation for all of what I'll be working on in the future. ***And maybe this time I can contribute a little more too!***

As the weeks continue I'm really excited to see the small amount I was exposed to previously with fresh eyes and even some familiarity (hopefully). It's kind of interesting to see the parallel of how I felt last time to now. Especially seeing my fellow cohort members having the familiar struggles of getting set up and learning the syntax for the first time, etc. I may not know much more than last time I was here, but it wasn't long ago I felt probably almost exactly the same as some of them felt right now. But having my break actually helped me see the light at the end of the tunnel better, if that makes sense. I'm nowhere close to knowing enough and I'm still very much a beginner who will definitely fail a lot for the next 3 months, but hey this newfound confidence feels pretty good for right now! :smile: (just wait til we get back into javascript again, I might be eating my words haha :sweat_smile:)

Anyways! If you're still here after all that, Hi it's nice to meet you! A little bit about me, my name is Andie, I'm a 30-year old Asian-American living in Kentucky, hoping to move to California eventually. I'm half-thai, half-white, and I split my childhood between Kentucky, Thailand, and Myanmar. I've always been a crafty-art-kid so if I start comparing coding to crochet don't be too surprised later. :satisfied: I have a lot of hobbies and I'm a **huge** stationary nerd so if you ever need to know what are the best pens and paper to use, you've come to the right place! I also go down rabbit-hole hobby obsessions almost monthly, and currently it's crochet :yarn: and fountain pens :black_nib:! ***...maybe I can find a way to combine my hobbies with code later on...*** :thinking:

Okay! Enough blabbing! I'll be dumping my thoughts to myself here as well as keeping up with the blog prompts we're given. **I'll see you guys next week!** :wave:
